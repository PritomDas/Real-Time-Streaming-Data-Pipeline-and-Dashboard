<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming application. Sparkify has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the application, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their application.

They'd like a data engineer to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. The role of this project is to create a data warehouse on cloud (AWS Redshift) and build ETL pipeline for this analysis. 

### Project Description

In this project, we will build a data warehouse on AWS and build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift.  The data is loaded from S3 buckets to staging tables on Redshift and modeled into fact and dimensions tables to perform analytics and obtain meaningful insights.

### Built With

* python
* AWS

### Dataset

#### Song Dataset

Songs dataset is a subset of [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file in the dataset is in JSON format and contains meta-data about a song and the artist of that song. The dataset is hosted at S3 bucket `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`.

Sample Record :

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### Log Dataset

Logs dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim). These log files in JSON format simulate activity logs from a music streaming application based on specified configurations. The dataset is hosted at S3 bucket `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`.

Sample Record :

```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```



## Database Schema Design

### Data Model ERD

The Star Database Schema (Fact and Dimension Schema) is used for data modeling in this ETL pipeline. There is one fact table containing all the metrics (facts) associated to each event (user actions), and four dimensions tables, containing associated information such as user name, artist name, song meta-data etc. This model enables to search the database schema with the minimum number of *SQL JOIN*s possible and enable fast read queries. The amount of data we need to analyze is not big enough to require big data solutions or NoSQL databases.

The data stored on S3 buckets is extracted to staging tables `staging_events` and `staging_songs` on Redshift. Then the data from these tables are transformed and inserted into the fact and dimensional tables. An entity relationship diagram (ERD) of the data model is given below.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Clone the repository into a local machine using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PritomDas/Mastery-in-Data-Engineering/tree/master/Udacity%20Data%20Engineering%20Nano%20Degree
```

### Prerequisites

These are the prerequisites to run the program.

* python 3.8.2 ( as of my current installation )
* PostgreSQL
* AWS account
* psycopg2 python library
* boto3 python library

### How to run

Follow the steps to extract and load the data into the data model.

1. Navigate to `Project 3 Data Warehouse on AWS` folder

2. Edit the `dwh.cfg` configuration file and fill in the AWS Access Key and Secret Key fields

3. Run `aws_cluster_create.py` to create the clusters on AWS by

   ```python
   python aws_cluster_create.py
   ```

   The type, number of nodes and other specifications of cluster will be as per the configuration file. Wait till cluster creation confirmation is displayed.

4. Run `create_tables.py` to create/reset the tables by

   ```python
   python create_tables.py
   ```

5. Run ETL process and load data into database by 

   ```python
   python etl.py
   ```

   This will execute SQL queries corresponding to staging data from S3 on Redshift and to transform and insert into the Postgres tables on Redshift.

6. Run `analyze.py` to validate the entry of data into tables by 

   ```python
   python analyze.py
   ```

    This runs some sample queries from all the tables created.

7. Run `aws_cluster_destroy.py` to destroy the clusters on AWS by

   ```python
   python aws_cluster_destroy.py
   ```
